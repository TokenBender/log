This is my log. My thoughts, ideas, and experiences. My experiments with the observable truth.

I am TokenBender. I am an engineer, a hacker, a citizen of the world.

I love to learn. I love to make tools. I love to solve problems. I love to create mischievious things.

I am a firm believer in the open web. 

My core philosophy is interacting with the AI world via tools of experimentation and observation.
