This page demonstrates how code rendering and math blocks work in Quarto.

## Code Rendering Examples

In this section, we'll demonstrate how code rendering works in Quarto. Here are some examples in different programming languages:

### Python

```python
import numpy as np

def add(a, b):
    return a + b

result = add(3, 4)
print(f"The result of add(3, 4) is: {result}")
```

Output:
```
The result of add(3, 4) is: 7
```

### JavaScript

```javascript
function multiply(a, b) {
  return a * b;
}

console.log(`The result of multiply(5, 6) is: ${multiply(5, 6)}`);
```

Output:
```
The result of multiply(5, 6) is: 30
```

## Math Blocks

In this section, we'll demonstrate how to use math blocks in Quarto. Math blocks allow you to display beautiful mathematical equations using LaTeX syntax.

### Inline Math

You can use inline math by enclosing your LaTeX code in single dollar signs. For example, the formula for the area of a circle is $A = \pi r^2$.

### Display Math

For more complex equations or when you want the math to be displayed on its own line, you can use display math blocks. These are created by enclosing the LaTeX code in double dollar signs.

Here's the quadratic formula:

$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
$$

### Multiple Equations

You can also display multiple equations in a single block:

$$
\begin{aligned}
E &= mc^2 \\
F &= ma \\
PV &= nRT
\end{aligned}
$$

### Matrix

Here's an example of a matrix:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
a & b & c \\
d & e & f \\
g & h & i
\end{bmatrix}
$$

### Calculus

Let's show a calculus example with an integral:

$$
\int_{0}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}
$$

These math blocks will render beautifully in your Quarto document, making it easy to include complex mathematical expressions in your content.
